## RecyclerViewAdapters Three Ways

### HeaderAdapter
A `RecyclerView.Adapter` for use when you only have items and a single static header view that you want to scroll with your list of items

### SectionAdapter
A `RecyclerView.Adapter` to use when you have several lists of items and you want each list to have a custom header and/or footer

### MultiTypeAdapter
The most extensible of the three - this `RecyclerView.Adapter` can be used with all kinds of heterogeneous data
